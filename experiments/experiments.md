#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I began to understand and learn about the phototransistor and resistor. As more light shines on the phototransistor this allows more current to flow and then increases the voltage towards 3V. When there is less light, the resistor helps pull the voltage down to 0V.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as for interactive art and displays where a light sensor is required.

### Experiment name ###

Experiment 3: DIMMING AN LED USING A POTENTIOMETER
