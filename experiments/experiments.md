#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I began to understand and learn about the phototransistor and resistor. As more light shines on the phototransistor this allows more current to flow and then increases the voltage towards 3V. When there is less light, the resistor helps pull the voltage down to 0V.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as for interactive art and displays where a light sensor is required.

Experiment 3: DIMMING AN LED USING A POTENTIOMETER

Fig. 3 (top), LED light is bright when potentiometer is turned anti-clockwise. Fig. 4 (bottom), LED light is dim when potentiometer is turned clockwise.

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something I learnt was using the variables (for light state) and pins (analog write to pin, analog read pin, etc). The analog value determines the brightness of the LED. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as for appliances and setting the brightness on display monitors.
