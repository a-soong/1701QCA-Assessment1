## Reading reflections ##

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

What I thought before: Very little as I know not much about design, besides that it should be user friendly (?). 

What I learned: The nuances in design and how the brain recognises different functions from our previous experiences using other products. 

What I would like to know more about: Other examples of what is good and bad design in our everyday life. 

How this relates to the project I am working on: It makes me think about my design for my projects. If something is clumsy, how can I signify how it's used or make it better? 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

What I thought before: That products have features.

What I learned: That there are more than just features within design, as well as the importance of microinteractions regardless of how subtle (or not) it is and the impact it has on a user's experience. It can make a product more pleasureable and easy to use even if we don't consciously remember that detail. 

What I would like to know more about: Other microinteractions that I use in my day to day life that I don't notice. 

How this relates to the project I am working on: This chapter makes me think about how I could improve my design to be more user friendly and less clunky, and how small things can change the overall experience of a product. 

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

What I thought before: I thought that in order to learn more about programming I'd have to study a relevant course.

What I learned: learning programming is extremely accessible with all the shared information online, and that there are options of other relatively affordable microcontrollers such as the Arduino that makes coding and creating these interactive objects accessible to the average joe. I also learnt that it's viable to learn as you progress and experiment with trial and error. 

What I would like to know more about: The capabilities of microcontrollers such as micro:bit and Arduino, and how I can use them to their potential in creating interactive objects for both this course and for my own enjoyment. 

How this relates to the project I am working on: As I progress through my replication project, the more I realise, like Sullivan I learn more as I go from trial and error than spending a chunk of time doing theory before even starting my endeavours. I've gone through multiple ideas and things that didn't work out, and even after 'finishing' my replication project there is still more I want to expand on and retry. 


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

### Reflection ###

I felt that if I had more time and didn't have other factors in play that I could create an object that is more thought out. The process was successful in achieving the outcome: measuring and displaying the velocity of Wheelchair Barbie, but it could improve with a better understand of design and understanding of materials e.g. finding a sturdier alternative to alligator clips, or why I chose to use x material instead of y. 
Unfortunately because of the current COVID-19 situation as well the stress, worriedness and safety has influenced my process of developing my project. Not having the chance to interact and attend all my classes each week, being more cautious of my surroundings and my own wellbeing has lead me to push this project to the back of my mind. I really wish the pandemic didn't have to be at this time, because I thoroughly enjoyed this project and would have spent more time on it if I could. I'm probably going to make an improved version after submission for my own satisfication. 

*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*
