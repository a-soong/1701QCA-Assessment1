This project is similar in the way it deals with distance and speed. This system is practical and simple in design.

The materials used (cardboard, micro:bit, aluminium foil, alligator clips) and the purpose of said materials is very similar to what I used to create my replication project. Having used a micro:bit for the 'computer' of the project and foil to carry the current of electricity as a means of sensor.

Although the Arduino Mate Dispenser has a completely different purpose, it shows how sensors can be used in many different ways and what these devices (Arduino, micro:bit etc.) have the potential of doing. 
## Reading reflections ##

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

What I thought before: Very little as I know not much about design, besides that it should be user friendly (?). 

What I learned: The nuances in design and how the brain recognises different functions from our previous experiences using other products. 

What I would like to know more about: Other examples of what is good and bad design in our everyday life. 

How this relates to the project I am working on: It makes me think about my design for my projects. If something is clumsy, how can I signify how it's used or make it better? 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

What I thought before: That products have features.

What I learned: That there are more than just features within design, as well as the importance of microinteractions regardless of how subtle (or not) it is and the impact it has on a user's experience. It can make a product more pleasureable and easy to use even if we don't consciously remember that detail. 

What I would like to know more about: Other microinteractions that I use in my day to day life that I don't notice. 

How this relates to the project I am working on: This chapter makes me think about how I could improve my design to be more user friendly and less clunky, and how small things can change the overall experience of a product. 

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

What I thought before: I thought that in order to learn more about programming I'd have to study a relevant course.

What I learned: learning programming is extremely accessible with all the shared information online, and that there are options of other relatively affordable microcontrollers such as the Arduino that makes coding and creating these interactive objects accessible to the average joe. I also learnt that it's viable to learn as you progress and experiment with trial and error. 

What I would like to know more about: The capabilities of microcontrollers such as micro:bit and Arduino, and how I can use them to their potential in creating interactive objects for both this course and for my own enjoyment. 

How this relates to the project I am working on: As I progress through my replication project, the more I realise, like Sullivan I learn more as I go from trial and error than spending a chunk of time doing theory before even starting my endeavours. I've gone through multiple ideas and things that didn't work out, and even after 'finishing' my replication project there is still more I want to expand on and retry.

### Speeding Wheelchair Barbie ###

### Project description ###

Speeding Wheelchair Barbie is an interactive model that measures the velocity of a vehicle passing through - the vehicle in this case being a Wheelchair. This is intended to be a novelty interactive toy, but can be applied to a real life scenario if we ever had wheelchairs on the road and had to fine speeders.

### Reflection ###

I felt that if I had more time and didn't have other factors in play that I could create an object that is more thought out. The process was successful in achieving the outcome: measuring and displaying the velocity of Wheelchair Barbie, but it could improve with a better understand of design and understanding of materials e.g. finding a sturdier alternative to alligator clips, or why I chose to use x material instead of y. 
Unfortunately because of the current COVID-19 situation as well the stress, worriedness and safety has influenced my process of developing my project. Not having the chance to interact and attend all my classes each week, being more cautious of my surroundings and my own wellbeing has lead me to push this project to the back of my mind. I really wish the pandemic didn't have to be at this time, because I thoroughly enjoyed this project and would have spent more time on it if I could. I'm probably going to make an improved version after submission for my own satisfication. 

As my project was quite straightforward and for the most part, replicated the original timing gate project. To calculate the velocity I had to look into some math sources as I've retained nothing from highschool. 
*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
